# Scrolling Characters on an LED Matrix using a MAX7219
Create moving messages easily!

# See video #25 at https://www.youtube.com/RalphBacon

Sending characters to an LED Matrix to create a scrolling message is child's play when we use a standard library to do all the hard work for us.

This video shows you how to connect four LED matrices together and produce scrolling messages - either predefined or what you type in on the serial port.

This really is a plug-and-play type operation that can really add the WOW factor to your project for very little outlay, either in terms of cost or programming effort.

If you want to delve deeper in understanding how to create your own (scrolling) characters you'll have to wait for part 2 of this video in the coming weeks (that is, it's not going to be my next video, sorry).
